# Victory

Chaos is over. Victory is now.

Victory makes volunteer management awesome. It keeps track of applications, teams, and contact information. Its interface is responsive and a pleasure to use, making a once complicated task the easiest thing in the world.

## Getting Started

Get a copy of Victory up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Installation

Start by setting up your virtual environment:

```
$ virtualenv venv
```


Then activate it:

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```


Now you're ready to install the requirements:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then do regular Django stuff. This will be elaborated later.

## Built With

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Web framework.
* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) - Isolated Python environments.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front-end component library.
* [Font Awesome 4](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon library.

## Contributing

We love pull requests! We're still in the early stages and development is happening rapidly. You're always welcome to send a pull request which we'll review and (most probably) merge. Victory is a commercial system, but we're simply not able to compensate your work, which is why all contributions must be considered a donation. Other than that, there's only one thing left to say: tabs.
